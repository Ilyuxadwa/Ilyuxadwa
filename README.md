# About me
## Personal Info
My name is Ilya, but everyone knows me as **Ilyuxadwa**. I’m creative and focused on my goals. I like experimenting with new ideas and turning concepts into real projects. I'm a friendly and calm and flexible person, so it’s okay for me to work both ways: solo and in teams. If someone needs my help and I have possibility to do that - I’ll give it for sure. In daily life, I try to spend time on useful things, but I also leave some time to **take a break from work** and keep motivation (games, movies, etc).  I always want to learn new tools, improve my skills, and adapt to new challenges.

## Professional Info

I started coding at a young age and now have **6+ years of experience**.  
I’ve worked on many projects such as **bots, utilities, games, and mods**.  
I also have good knowledge of **cybersecurity basics**.


In my own projects, I often work as a **designer**. I’m still improving, but I learn fast and creativity is one of my strongest sides.

As a project manager, I usually worked solo — creating big ideas, balancing game systems, and keeping projects updated and organized.

My main focus is **game development**. I like building projects from a small idea into a full product — from brainstorming and balancing systems to development and publishing.
